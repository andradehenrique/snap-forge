# Image Processing Scripts

This repository contains a collection of Bash scripts for automating common image processing tasks. You can add watermarks, convert images to WebP format, resize images, and even perform all these operations at once!

## Features

- **Add watermark**: Overlays an image as a watermark.
- **Convert to WebP**: Converts images to WebP format, optimizing size without losing quality.
- **Resize images**: Creates thumbnails with custom dimensions.
- **Complete processing**: A single script that runs all the above operations in sequence.

## Repository Structure

- `watermark.sh`: Adds a watermark to images.
- `convert-to-webp.sh`: Converts images to WebP format.
- `thumbnails.sh`: Resizes images, creating thumbnails.
- `process-images.sh`: Runs all three operations in sequence.

## Requirements

- Linux or macOS with Bash installed.
- CLI tools: `imagemagick`, `libwebp`.

To install dependencies on Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install imagemagick webp
```

To install dependencies on Fedora:

sudo dnf install imagemagick libwebp-tools
```
